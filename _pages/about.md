I am a 1st year Computer Science M.S. student at Cornell University, advised by [Professor Sanjiban Choudhury](https://sanjibanc.github.io/). 

My research lies in the intersection of Machine Learning and Robotics, with the goal of employing robots with skills necessary to interact safely and seamlessly with humans when completing everyday tasks. I recently have been tackling the problem of learning optimal robot behaviors from human activity demonstrations.

I have also honed my Software Engineering skills through industry roles, and aim to leverage my experience applying Machine Learning to real-world problems in a Research & Development setting.

I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at Cornell in 2024, where I was a part of academic (Cornell Cup Robotics) and recreational (Pro-Yos, Assorted Aces, E.Motion) clubs beyond my research efforts. In my free time, I enjoy Chinese Yo-Yo'ing and dancing.
