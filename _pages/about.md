I am entering the final year of my Computer Science M.S. at Cornell University, advised by [Professor Sanjiban Choudhury](https://sanjibanc.github.io/) and [Professor Wei-Chiu Ma](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~weichiu/).

I work on training robotic agents from human demonstrations in everyday environments. My research interests span learning from human videos, imitation learning (IL), reinforcement learning (RL), and sim-to-real as they serve as the scalable pathways towards learning general purpose robot skills.

Additionally, I am an incoming [CVML Research Intern @ Apple](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/), and have prior internship experience as a [Software Engineering Intern @ MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

In my free time, I enjoy Chinese Yo-Yo'ing and dancing.
